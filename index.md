The **7<sup>th</sup> International School and Workshop on Proof Theory** will
be organized by **Ghent University** under the auspices of [The Proof
Society](https://www.proofsociety.org/). This annual event continues its
tradition of uniting students, researchers, and practitioners to explore both
the applied and foundational aspects of proof theory.

Following the format of previous editions, the event begins with a three-day
**Summer School (September 1–3)** offering five tutorials on a variety of
topics related to proof theory. This will be followed by a two-day **Workshop
(September 4–5)** featuring invited lectures and contributed talks.

Guided by [The Proof
Manifesto](https://www.proofsociety.org/the-proof-manifesto/), this event
embraces the notion of proofs in its broadest sense, welcoming participation
and contributions from logic, computer science, mathematics, and beyond.
